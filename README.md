A collection of programms I wrote during my master course "Computational methods in solid state physics" and "Monte Carlo methods".
Also added little private project on simple perceptron model neural networks.

This is thought more as a demonstration of my coding style than as a representation of the courses I have done, since the list of projects is rather incomplete.
